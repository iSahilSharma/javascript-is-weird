## Close Encounters:
 #### `Array.prototype.sort()`
 
According to MDN, the `sort()` method sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array. The default sort order is ascending, built upon converting the elements into strings, then comparing their sequences of UTF-16 code units values.
The time and space complexity of the sort cannot be guaranteed as it depends on the implementation. 

Let's consider an example:

    const months = ['March', 'Jan', 'Feb', 'Dec'];
    months.sort();
    console.log(months); 
    
    Output: Array ["Dec", "Feb", "Jan", "March"]`

Seems working, right? Wait until you run the following code:

    const numbers = [1, 30, 4, 21, 100000];
    numbers.sort();
    console.log(numbers); 
 
 #### What do you thing will be the output of numbers?   
 As per the normal understanding, the strings should be sorted alphabetically and numbers numerically. Hence, we expect the output to be:
 
      Output: Array [1, 4, 21, 30, 100000]

However, the output comes to be:
    
      Output: Array [1, 100000, 21, 30, 4]
 
This is my first dumbfound encounter with JavaScript. The reason for this is sort method converts the elements inside the array into strings and then sort them alphabetically. This is called [lexicographical order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical_order).

>This is why you'll see episode numberings on media files (S1E01) with a prepended 0 so a lexicographic sort doesn't mess things up and allows programs to simply play/display in alphabetical order.

To get the sort function to perform numerical sort, we need to tweak the method:

For ES5 and lower versions:

    const numbers = [1, 30, 4, 21, 100000];
    numbers.sort(function(a,b){ return a - b; });
    console.log(numbers); 
    
For ES6 onwards:

    const numbers = [1, 30, 4, 21, 100000];
    numbers.sort((a,b) => a - b);   // For ascending sort
    numbers.sort((a,b) => b - a);   // For descending sort
    console.log(numbers); 
    
 The expression `a-b` sorts the array based on the following three condtions:
 
 - If a-b = 0 `a and b should be considered equals and hence no sorting will be performed`
 - If a-b > 0 `Sort b to the lower index of a`
 - If a-b < 0 `Sort a to the lower index of b`

 #### `Type coercion`
 
According to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Type_coercion), Type coercion is the automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another (such as strings to numbers). Type conversion is similar to type coercion because they both convert values from one data type to another with one key difference â€” type coercion is implicit whereas type conversion can be either implicit or explicit.

Let's consider an example:

    let num1 = 22;
    let num2 = 2;
    
    let sum = num1 + num2;
    let diff = num1 - num2;
    console.log(sum); 
    console.log(diff); 
    
    Output: 24, 20
    
 Seems working, right? Wait until you run the following code:

    let num1 = 22;
    let num2 = '2';
    
    let sum = num1 + num2;
    let diff = num1 - num2;
    console.log(sum);     
    console.log(diff); 
    
    Output: 222, 20
 
This is like the biggest dumbfound experience and before you start scratichg your head, it is caused because of `+` operator. `+` operator in JavaScript has two meanings:

>   Plus Operator 
>
>   Concatenation Operator
  
If both the left and right side of the operator consists a number, it works as plus operator and adds the numbers, else if any of the side  contains string or other type, it concatenates the sides. In case of `-` operator, it works as negation operator for all the scenarios and converts the non-number types into number.
